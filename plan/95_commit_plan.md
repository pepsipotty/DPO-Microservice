# DPO Reorg Commit Plan

## Commit Strategy

The reorganization changes are clustered into logical groups following Conventional Commit format. Each commit is atomic and represents a cohesive set of changes.

## Commit Groups

### 1. feat: reorganize codebase into domain-driven architecture

**Type**: `feat` (new package structure provides new organizational capabilities)
**Files**:
- `core/` (new package)
- `datasets/` (new package) 
- `storage/` (new package)
- `training/` (new package)
- `tools/` (new package)
- Delete: `preference_datasets.py` (moved to `datasets/`)

**Rationale**: Core functionality reorganization into proper package boundaries. This is the primary architectural change.

### 2. feat: add configuration schemas and contracts

**Type**: `feat` (new validation and contract system)
**Files**:
- `config/schemas/` (new directory)
- `core/validators.py` (new file)
- `datasets/__init__.py` (new interface)
- `storage/__init__.py` (new interface)

**Rationale**: New configuration validation system and interface contracts that enable safer configuration management.

### 3. chore: improve development experience and operations

**Type**: `chore` (tooling and development workflow improvements)
**Files**:
- `Makefile` (new file)
- `.env.example` (new file)
- `tests/test_api.py` (new file)
- Update: `Dockerfile`

**Rationale**: Development tooling, build improvements, and example configurations that don't change core functionality.

### 4. docs: update documentation and planning artifacts

**Type**: `docs` (documentation updates)
**Files**:
- `plan/` (entire directory)
- Update: `README.md`

**Rationale**: Comprehensive documentation of the reorganization process and updated project documentation.

### 5. refactor: update imports and references

**Type**: `refactor` (code structure changes without behavior change)
**Files**:
- Update: `webhook_handler.py`
- Update: `__pycache__/preference_datasets.cpython-312.pyc`

**Rationale**: Import path updates required after package reorganization. Behavior remains identical.

## Commit Messages

1. `feat: reorganize codebase into domain-driven architecture`
   
   - Split monolithic structure into packages: core/, datasets/, storage/, training/, tools/
   - Move preference_datasets.py to datasets/ package
   - Establish clear package boundaries for better maintainability
   - Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing APIs

2. `feat: add configuration schemas and contracts`
   
   - Add JSON Schema validation for training, model, and loss configs
   - Implement interface contracts for datasets and storage
   - Add core validators for configuration validation
   - Enable safer configuration management with type checking

3. `chore: improve development experience and operations`
   
   - Add comprehensive Makefile with 20+ development commands
   - Optimize Docker build with multi-layer caching
   - Add .env.example for environment variable documentation
   - Implement API integration tests for webhook endpoints

4. `docs: update documentation and planning artifacts`
   
   - Add comprehensive reorganization planning documents
   - Update README with new package structure and usage
   - Document architectural decisions and validation results
   - Include Mermaid diagrams for system architecture

5. `refactor: update imports and references`
   
   - Update import paths after package reorganization
   - Refresh compiled Python cache files
   - Maintain identical behavior with new package structure

## Validation Commands

After each commit group:
```bash
# Verify package imports
python -c "import core, datasets, storage, training, tools; print('âœ… All packages import successfully')"

# Test API endpoints
make test-api

# Verify training pipeline
make toy-trigger

# Check Docker build
make docker-build
```

## Exclusions

- Cache files (`__pycache__/`) - will be regenerated
- Data files (`data/`) - not part of code structure
- IDE files (`.vscode/`) - development environment specific
- Credentials (`serviceKey.json`) - excluded for security
